# Urdu IMDB Reviews Classification using Finetuned DistilBERT

## The Journey Through the Notebook
This project takes a systematic and insightful approach to bring Urdu sentiment analysis to life. Here’s what it entails:

## 1. The Dataset: IMDB Reviews in Urdu
The notebook kicks off with a deep dive into a dataset of IMDB reviews, translated into Urdu. It explores the unique challenges of working with Urdu, a script with rich linguistic features and a context-heavy grammar. The key steps include:
<br>**Data Cleaning:** Addressing inconsistencies in translations and ensuring the reviews are sentimentally representative.
<br>**Labeling Sentiments:** Classifying reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories to provide a clear framework for training.

## 2. Leveraging DistilBERT for Urdu
DistilBERT, a smaller, faster version of BERT, is the model of choice for this project. The notebook demonstrates:
<br>**Model Preparation:** Adapting DistilBERT to process Urdu text effectively, including tokenization tailored for non-Latin scripts.
<br>**Fine-Tuning:** Training the model on labeled Urdu reviews, optimizing it to identify sentiment nuances specific to the language.

## 3. Evaluating Success
The results are more than just numbers — they’re a testament to the potential of AI in understanding diverse languages:
<br>**Performance Metrics:** Measuring the model’s success in accurately classifying sentiments using precision, recall, and F1 scores.
<br>**Error Analysis:** Discussing challenges, like handling mixed sentiments or addressing idiomatic expressions in Urdu, and identifying areas for improvement.
Why This Project Matters
Urdu is spoken by over 230 million people worldwide, yet its digital presence remains limited. Projects like this demonstrate how technology can bridge that gap, making sentiment analysis tools accessible to Urdu speakers and paving the way for further advancements in multilingual NLP.

## Who Should Read This?
NLP Practitioners: Learn how to adapt pre-trained models like DistilBERT for non-English languages.
<br>**Researchers:** Gain insights into the challenges and solutions for low-resource language sentiment analysis.
<br>**Language Enthusiasts:** Discover the impact of AI on preserving and empowering linguistic diversity.
By fine-tuning DistilBERT for Urdu sentiment analysis, this project not only advances machine learning but also contributes to a more inclusive and multilingual AI landscape.
